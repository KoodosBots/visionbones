# Feature Planning Template - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This template provides a comprehensive approach to planning any feature from conception to completion using industry-standard methodologies. It combines elements from Agile, Design Thinking, and Product Management best practices to ensure thorough planning and successful execution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Discovery and Research Phase

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conducting user research THEN the team SHALL identify at least 3 primary user personas
2. WHEN analyzing the problem THEN the team SHALL document current pain points and user workflows
3. WHEN researching competitors THEN the team SHALL analyze at least 3 similar solutions in the market
4. WHEN gathering requirements THEN the team SHALL prioritize features using MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have)
5. IF stakeholder interviews are conducted THEN the team SHALL document all functional and non-functional requirements

### Requirement 2: Problem Definition and Validation

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want to clearly define and validate the problem we're solving, so that the development effort addresses real user needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining the problem THEN the team SHALL create a clear problem statement in one sentence
2. WHEN validating the problem THEN the team SHALL gather evidence from at least 5 potential users
3. WHEN measuring impact THEN the team SHALL define success metrics and KPIs
4. WHEN assessing feasibility THEN the team SHALL evaluate technical, business, and user experience constraints
5. IF the problem is validated THEN the team SHALL document the business case and expected ROI

### Requirement 3: Solution Design and Architecture

**User Story:** As a development team, I want a comprehensive design and architecture plan, so that I can build a scalable and maintainable solution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating user flows THEN the team SHALL map out all primary and secondary user journeys
2. WHEN designing the system THEN the team SHALL create high-level architecture diagrams
3. WHEN planning data models THEN the team SHALL define all entities, relationships, and data flows
4. WHEN considering integrations THEN the team SHALL identify all external APIs and services needed
5. WHEN designing UI/UX THEN the team SHALL create wireframes and mockups for all key screens
6. IF security is required THEN the team SHALL define authentication, authorization, and data protection measures

### Requirement 4: Technical Planning and Risk Assessment

**User Story:** As a technical lead, I want to identify potential risks and technical challenges early, so that I can plan mitigation strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assessing technical risks THEN the team SHALL identify and rate all potential technical blockers
2. WHEN planning the tech stack THEN the team SHALL justify technology choices based on requirements
3. WHEN estimating effort THEN the team SHALL break down work into small, estimable tasks
4. WHEN considering scalability THEN the team SHALL plan for expected load and growth
5. WHEN planning deployment THEN the team SHALL define CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure needs
6. IF dependencies exist THEN the team SHALL identify and plan for all external dependencies

### Requirement 5: Implementation Strategy and Roadmap

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want a clear implementation roadmap with milestones, so that I can track progress and manage stakeholder expectations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the roadmap THEN the team SHALL define clear phases with deliverables
2. WHEN planning sprints THEN the team SHALL organize work into 1-2 week iterations
3. WHEN setting milestones THEN the team SHALL define measurable outcomes for each phase
4. WHEN planning testing THEN the team SHALL define testing strategy for each development phase
5. WHEN considering rollout THEN the team SHALL plan feature flags and gradual release strategy
6. IF the project is complex THEN the team SHALL identify MVP scope for early validation

### Requirement 6: Quality Assurance and Testing Strategy

**User Story:** As a quality assurance lead, I want a comprehensive testing plan, so that I can ensure the feature meets quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN planning unit tests THEN the team SHALL achieve minimum 80% code coverage
2. WHEN planning integration tests THEN the team SHALL test all API endpoints and data flows
3. WHEN planning user acceptance tests THEN the team SHALL create test scenarios for all user stories
4. WHEN planning performance tests THEN the team SHALL define load testing requirements
5. WHEN planning security tests THEN the team SHALL include vulnerability and penetration testing
6. IF the feature affects existing functionality THEN the team SHALL plan regression testing

### Requirement 7: Launch and Post-Launch Planning

**User Story:** As a product team, I want a clear launch plan and post-launch monitoring strategy, so that I can ensure successful feature adoption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN planning the launch THEN the team SHALL define go-live criteria and rollback procedures
2. WHEN planning monitoring THEN the team SHALL set up analytics and error tracking
3. WHEN planning user communication THEN the team SHALL create user documentation and announcements
4. WHEN planning support THEN the team SHALL prepare customer support materials and training
5. WHEN planning iteration THEN the team SHALL define feedback collection and improvement processes
6. IF the feature requires training THEN the team SHALL create user onboarding materials

### Requirement 8: Success Measurement and Optimization

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want to measure feature success and plan optimizations, so that I can continuously improve the user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN measuring adoption THEN the team SHALL track user engagement and feature usage metrics
2. WHEN measuring performance THEN the team SHALL monitor system performance and response times
3. WHEN measuring satisfaction THEN the team SHALL collect user feedback through surveys or interviews
4. WHEN analyzing data THEN the team SHALL create dashboards for key metrics and KPIs
5. WHEN planning improvements THEN the team SHALL prioritize optimizations based on data insights
6. IF issues are identified THEN the team SHALL create action plans for addressing problems
